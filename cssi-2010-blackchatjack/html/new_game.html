<h1>How to Play</h1>
<br />
<center><b>Objective: </b> Beat the dealer. </center>

<br /><br />
Cards are counted at face value, except for Aces (which are counted as 1 or 11).<br /><br />
Each player is dealt two cards, one face up, and one face down.<br /><br />
The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a combined value 21.<br /><br />
You also win when you have a higher value than the dealer, or when the dealer busts.<br /><br />
After you get your cards, you can choose to <font color = "FF0000"><b>HIT</b></font>, or draw another card, or <font color = "FF0000"><b>STAY</b></font>, not drawing anymore cards.<br /><br />
The game ends when both players choose to stay. <br /><br /><br />
